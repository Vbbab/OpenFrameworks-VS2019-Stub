# OpenFrameworks-VS2019-Stub
An OpenFrameworks project stub for using OF on VS 2019.

*This project is based off of the empty project structure included with OF (apps/myApps/emptyExample), retargeted to WinSDK `10.0.18362.0` and platform toolset `v142`.*

# How to use
1. Install the latest version of OF from their [download site](https://openframeworks.cc/download/) **(Make sure to get "Visual Studio 2017" zip)**,

extract the zip somewhere.

2. Clone this repo, put the folder inside of `apps/myApps` from the unzipped install.

3. Go into `emptyExample/`, open `emptyExample.sln` in VS 2019.

4. Bam. Ready for use.


*Based off of instructions from [this repo](https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/the-setup-to-use-of-with-vs-2019/33077/3), but with an actual blank repo that is pre-retargeted.*

*If you need to retarget for some reason, you should be able to do this normally in VS 2019*.
